This code attempts to use the `elem` function to check if a value is present in an infinite list. This will cause the program to run indefinitely because `elem` will traverse the entire list before returning a result.  The function `takeWhile` is not helpful here either, as it stops when the predicate is false, but the predicate (`== 3`) will never be false within this specific infinite list.
